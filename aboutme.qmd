#### Bio

![](headshot.jpg){fig-align="center"}

I am a second year part-time PhD student in Epidemiology at UGA. I have spent over five years working in sub-Saharan Africa on both HIV and malaria programs at the health facility and community levels. I now work in the Malaria Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. My research interests include infectious diseases, particularly malaria, with a focus on molecular epidemiology and antimalarial resistance.

#### Statistical Background

I have used R in classes and for some simple statistical analyses and visuals at work, but overall, my experience is very informal, and always involves *a lot* of googling.) What I love about R is the level of online community engagement and discussion between people using it for such a wide variety of purposes. It can be frustrating at times, but it is by far my favorite statistical software I have worked with.

I am quite confident in study design, but the data analysis requirements for the research I do at work generally look fairly similar each time, and I have not had the confidence to explore or branch out into more complicated analyses on my own. My aim in participating in this course is to expand my R toolkit and also to gain confidence in using R more in my day to day work. I really love data visualization, so learning more about how to use Tableau with R would be another really exciting opportunity for me.

### Interesting Fact

I come from a big, fat, Greek family. I have relatives named Hercules, Antigone, and Socrates to name a few!

#### Data Visualization: When Americans are Happiest

I have been a long time follower of various data visualization blogs, and one of my favorites is called [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/). They shared a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97TVAHLGXe8) of an interesting example of creative visualization, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021 American Time Use Survey.

People were asked about their happiness throughout the day when they ate, traveled, watched television, took care of kids, and other activities, in addition to reporting happiness on a scale from 0 to 6, where 0 was not happy at all and 6 was very happy. The animation shows the average happiness for the fifty most common activities in individuals from age 20 to 70.
