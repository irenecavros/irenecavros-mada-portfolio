***Summary***

Data for this exercise was pulled from the CDC's data repository. [This dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Drug-Poisoning-Mortality-by-County-United-Sta/pbkm-d27e) describes drug poisoning deaths at the county level by selected demographic characteristics and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.

**Loading packages, dataset, and reviewing the raw data:**

---

```{r}
#load packages
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(naniar)

#load dataset
drug_poison_data <- read_csv("dataanalysis-exercise/data/raw_data/drug_poison_data.csv")

#examine data
summary(drug_poison_data)

```

---
**Creating a new dataframe called "data" with variables of interest:**

The selected variables here are year, state, county, population and death rate.

```{r}
#refined dataset with only variables of interest
data <- drug_poison_data %>%
    select(year, state, county, population, death_rate)
```

**Filter to look at only cases in Georgia:**

```{r}
georgia <- data %>%
  filter(state %in% "Georgia")

```

This new final dataset (georgia) gives us cases of drug poisoning from 1999-2015 in the state of Georgia.

**Save cleaned data as an RDS file in processed_data folder:**

```{r}
saveRDS(georgia, file="dataanalysis-exercise/data/processed_data/georgia_clean.rds")
```

**Save summary table:**

```{r}
#make summary table
summary_georgia = data.frame(do.call(cbind, lapply(georgia, summary)))
print(summary_georgia)

#save it as an RDS file
saveRDS(summary_georgia, file="dataanalysis-exercise/results/summary_georgia.rds")
```
